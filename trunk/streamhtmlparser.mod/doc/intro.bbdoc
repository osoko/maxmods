<p>
StreamHtmlParse, is an mplementation of an html and javascript context scanner
with no lookahead.<br>
Its purpose is to scan an html document and provide context information at any point
within the input stream. An example use of this scanner would be an auto escaping
templating system, which would require html context information at very specific
points within the html stream.<br>
The implementation is based on a simplified state machine of HTML4.1 and javascript.
