
Using libfmodex.dylib in a Bundle
---------------------------------

libfmodex.dylib needs to be modified to work from inside an application bundle.

When you run "otool -D libfmodex.dylib", it will output the following :

libfmodex.dylib:
./libfmodex.dylib


This won't work with an application bundle. The library name must be prefixed with "@executable_path". We can 
convert it as follows :

install_name_tool -id @executable_path/libfmodex.dylib libfmodex.dylib


When we again run otool, the result will be :

libfmodex.dylib:
@executable_path/libfmodex.dylib


... It's also possible that the following error may occur on older PPC versions :

	...lib/macos/libfmodex.dylib load command 4 unknown cmd field	


If this happens, the following command should fix it :

	strip -S -arch ppc -no_uuid libfmodex.dylib


However, you do need at least XCode 2.5, but we'll try to make sure the version included with BaH.FMOD is fixed already.



The dylib can now be used inside your application bundle.


The dylib shipped with BaH.FMOD has already been "fixed".
