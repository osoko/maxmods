# Introduction #

[MAPM](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ringx004/mapm-main.html) is an Arbitrary Precision Math library which allows you to process numbers with much greater precision than normal integers or doubles. In fact, MAPM support numbers with up to 2^31 digits. That's 2,147,483,647 digits.

BaH.MAPM provides you with a BlitzMax language-binding to MAPM, enabling you to add support for very large numbers to your applications :-)
