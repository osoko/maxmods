  The Sword Kanji font FAQ

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *

      Ok, I have downloaded the font. Now what? How do I install it?

      This is somewhat beyond the scope of this FAQ, but a good start
      would be to go to the /control panel/ of your computer. From there
      you should have a /font/ folder. Dropping the file into this
      folder should make it appear in the font menu of your applications.

      I have installed the font, I can see it in the font menu of my
      application, now how do I use it to type a japanese word?

      Sorry, but this is /really/ beyond the scope of this FAQ. You
      should turn to the web site of your operating system's
      manufacturer for more information on this subject. This is
      generally refered as installing a japanese IME (Input Method Editor).

      I can't find any roman letter, digit or punctuation in the font!

      These glyphs were missing from the original fonts
      <http://members.cox.net/jkk/kanji.htm> from Jim Kurrasch. If you
      find someone skillful enough to draw these glyphs, then I will
      have them mapped with the rest.

      Some kanjis are missing from the font!

      If it is missing from the font then it was probably missing from
      the original fonts <http://members.cox.net/jkk/kanji.htm> from Jim
      Kurrasch. If you find someone skillful enough to draw this glyph,
      then I will have it mapped with the rest.

      Some glyphs are not nicely space separated! Some overlaping each
      other, etc.

      You are right! There is definitly a spacing problem but I can't
      correct this because I don't know much about font design! If you
      can determine where this problem comes from, then contact me
      <email-me/email_form.htm> and we will publish a better version of
      the Sword Kanji font.

      Some glyph is being mapped to an improper unicode!

      Drop me a line <email-me/email_form.htm> with the code of the
      ideogram, I will have it remapped correctly.

    *

      I inspected the inside of the font file, and found out that some
      glyphs are not mapped to any unicode yet?

      Right, I could not find the unicode for some of the glyphs that
      were present in the original fonts
      <http://members.cox.net/jkk/kanji.htm> from Jim Kurrasch. These
      are glyphs number |$0197, $0199, $019C, $01A0, $01A2, $01AF,
      $01B9, $0288, $02B4, $0361, $0401, $04CD, $061D| and all
      combinated kanas (sha, shu, sho, etc.)
      If you can find out what are the unicodes for these then drop me a
      line <email-me/email_form.htm>
