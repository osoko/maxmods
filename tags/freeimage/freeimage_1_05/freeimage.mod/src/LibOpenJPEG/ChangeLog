What's New for OpenJPEG

July 13, 2007
! [FOD] Modified the memory allocation for codestreams containing multiple tiles. The memory is now allocated for each tile indenpendently, leading to an important decrease of the virtual memory needed. [j2k.c tcd.h tcd.c]
! [FOD] Modified old comments about the ability to decode mega-images and comments about the disk size necessary to do this. [image_to_j2k.c and frames_to_mj2.c]
* [FOD] Added 2000 bytes for the memory allocation in cio.c for the minimum size of headers (useful in case of very small images) [cio.c]

July 12, 2007
* [GB] fixed a bug in JPWL module, which prevented to exploit the full error correction capability of RS codes (e.g. it gave up at 5 errors, even if 6 were correctable); defined a JPWL_MAXIMUM_EPB_ROOM for better customization of the maximum dimension of EPBs (the dimension is pre-calculated on an hypothesis, if it goes beyond 65535 there will be problems, thus we give a little less than the max, let's say 65450)

July 8, 2007
* [ANTONIN] fixed the size of the memory allocation in cio.c (confusion between bits and bytes)

June 21, 2007
* [FOD] Output image color space set when decoding a JP2 file in jp2.c
+ [GB] Previous, home, and next frame buttons for exploring MJ2 files in OPJViewer

June 18, 2007
* [GB] Reload image doesn't crash in OPJViewer; more settings saved to registry
 
June 16, 2007
+ [GB] Possibility to disable parsing in OPJViewer; also, saves common settings to the registry

June 15, 2007
* [FOD] Fixed the generation of index files 


----------------------
MAY 4, 2007
VERSION 1.2.0 RELEASED
----------------------

May 4, 2007
* [FOD] Bugs corrected in decoding of command line (getopt.c), in the handling of 16 bit files (t1.c and tcd.c) and the calculation of elapsed time for multiple tiles parts (tcd.c and tdc.h).

June 2, 2007
+ [GB] OPJViewer opens now BMP, PNG, GIF, PNM, TIFF (with wxWidgets internals); added an encoder settings tab, for future integration with "save file as..." in JPEG 2000 format

May 31, 2007
* [FOD] Fixed the handling of 16bit TIFF files for cinema compression. Modified "convert.c"
* [FOD] Fixed the parameters used for cinema compression (9-7 transform used instead of 5-3). Modified "image_to_j2k.c"

May 24, 2007
* [FOD] Bug fixed by Sylvain Munaut. Change in the reading of the POC marker. Since COD/COC can be anywhere in the header, the decoder cannot always know while decoding the POC marker the value of numlayers and numresolution.

May 23, 2007
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This makes the t1 data arrays dynamic, which greatly reduces cache thrashing. Also, some minor cleanup to prevent unnecessary casts"

May 22, 2007
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "Some formatting cleanups, so that the long function definitions and calls fit on screen. Use of prefix increment which is theoretically faster, in practice any sane compiler can optimize a postfix increment but its best not to count on such things. Consolidation of some redundant calculations in the inner loops, which becomes very useful in the future autovectorize patch."
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This changes the flag code in t1 to use a flag_t type, which can then be changed to reduce RAM usage. It is now typedef to a short."
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This patch makes the t1 LUTs static. I actually intend this as a prelude to possibly eliminating some or all of the LUTs entirely."

May 11, 2007
- [FOD]	JP3D library Binaries removed from SVN.
! [FOD] MJ2 codec updated from LibOpenJPEG version 0.97 to LibOpenJPEG version 1. Hence, the MJ2 codec will now take advantage of all the improvements and optimizations done on the LibOpenJPEG library.
! [FOD] Possibility to choose to apply MCT (multiple component transform) enabled, and new decoding_limit: DECODE_ALL_BUT_PACKETS (openjpeg.h)

March 28, 2007
* [FOD] Fixed an historical bug in t1.c that leaded to the inclusion of useless 0xFF in the codestream. Thanks to Sylvain, Pascal and Parvatha !

March 27, 2007

----------------------
February 23, 2007
VERSION 1.1.1 RELEASED
----------------------

February 23, 2007
* [GB] Fixed a copy-and-paste type assignment error (bool instead of int) in the JPWL section of decoder parameters structure in openjpeg.h; minor type-casting in jpwl_lib.c. As a result, now OPJViewer should run correctly when built against the most current SVN trunk of LibOpenJPEG.lib

February 13, 2007
! [FOD] David Fries suggestions. In image_to_j2k and j2k_to_image, strncpy() functions: instead of specifying the path size macro, let the compiler read the length out of the array entry.
! [FOD] David Fries suggestions. Makefile modified. -fPIC flag used for 64-bit compilation. Move operation (rather than copy) for the dist library creation, and -p flag added.

January 31, 2007
! [FOD] Extra tokens at the end of #endif directive corrected in openjpeg.c, j2k.c and image_to_j2k.c -> no more warnings in linux compilation
! [FOD] Linux Makefile added for the codec

January 30, 2007
! [FOD] Use of OPJ_PATH_LEN (defined as 4096) to be the maximum allowed size for filenames instead of MAX_PATH which is not always defined. This caused some programs using OpenJPEG to crash. Modifications in openjpeg.h j2k_to_image.c and image_to_j2k.c
! [FOD] Correction of the syntax usage in MJ2_codec/mj2_to_frames.c

January 23, 2007

December 07, 2006
+ [Giuseppe Baruffa] Antonin verified that the MacOS build suffered from a missing definition of the "min" macro; I've added this definition (properly #ifndef'ed) into both jpwl.h and rs.h

December 05, 2006
* [Giuseppe Baruffa] Better fix of the TPH EPBs bug in JPWL module
* [GB] Fixed the UEP bug in JPWL module; now, during a UEP specification, RS protection or CRC check can be switched off for selected range of packets, and consequently reswitched on without confusing the decoder
+ [GB] Added some lines in the help of JPWL_image_to_j2k, specifying that when using error protection on data packets, this must be paired with header protection, i.e. there cannot be packet protection without header protection

December 04, 2006

+ [Francois-Olivier Devaux] New tag: version1.0 (includes codec and libopenjpeg directories)
Total update of JPWL module
    - [FOD] removed directories jpwl/decoder, jpwl/encoder, jpwl/decoder_02, jpwl/encoder_02
