# Introduction #

The libcurlSSL module adds enhanced support for the protocols **FTP**, **FTPS**, **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, **TFTP**, **TELNET**, **DICT**, and **FILE**.

libcurl also supports **HTTP POST**, **HTTP PUT**, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication, file transfer resume, http proxy tunneling and more!

The Blitzmax libcurlSSL module also includes **c-ares**, a library that performs DNS requests and name resolves asynchronously.

As usual, this module is fully cross-platform with extensive documentation and some basic examples.

Requires:
[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) - This provides the secure SSL functionality. It comes as standard on Linux and Mac OS X systems. Win32 users can find a binary distribution from [here](http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). (The module includes headers for Win32, so only the "light" package is required.)
