#summary Regular Expressions

= Introduction =

The RegEx module uses [http://www.pcre.org PCRE] to provide integrated support for Regular Expressions.

Regular expressions allow you to define a pattern for use with Find/Replace, rather than a normal matching string. This makes it infinitely more powerful for complicated matching.

==Example==

Replace all numbers occurring in the following text with the string "!FLOAT!"

`floats are 4.533, -10.232, 1446.2003 and even 100 If it wasn't enough 5 out of 10 applications said their users preferred them. That's 0.50 !`

With the RegEx module you essentially only need this :
{{{
Local regex:TRegEx = TRegEx.Create("[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+")

Local s:String = regex.ReplaceAll(originalString, "!FLOAT!")
}}}

which will result in the string

`floats are !FLOAT!, !FLOAT!, !FLOAT! and even !FLOAT! If it wasn't enough !FLOAT! out of !FLOAT! applications said their users preferred them. That's !FLOAT! !`
