#summary A framework for a standard Database API.

= Introduction =

This is the core of a set of cross-platform modules to allow you to connect
to a variety of different databases using a standard set of Types and Functions.

Using a standard framework means that you don't have to learn or know anything about the underlying database API, since the framework takes care of all the nitty-gritty for you. This way, you only have to worry about the data and the SQLs to access it.

You can follow the module progress via the DatabaseModuleChangeLog.
