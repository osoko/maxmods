= Introduction =

The libcurlSSL module adds enhanced support for the protocols *FTP*, *FTPS*, *HTTP*, *HTTPS*, *TFTP*, *TELNET*, *DICT*, and *FILE*.

libcurl also supports *HTTP POST*, *HTTP PUT*, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication, file transfer resume, http proxy tunneling and more!

The Blitzmax libcurlSSL module also includes *c-ares*, a library that performs DNS requests and name resolves asynchronously.

As usual, this module is fully cross-platform with extensive documentation and some basic examples.

Requires:
[http://www.openssl.org/ OpenSSL] - This provides the secure SSL functionality. It comes as standard on Linux and Mac OS X systems. Win32 users can find a binary distribution from [http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html here]. (The module includes headers for Win32, so only the "light" package is required.)
