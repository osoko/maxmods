#summary A Multi-protocol File Transfer library
#labels libcurl

= Introduction =

The libcurl module adds enhanced support for the protocols *FTP*, *HTTP*, *TFTP*, *TELNET*, *DICT*, and *FILE*.

libcurl also supports *HTTP POST*, *HTTP PUT*, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication, file transfer resume, http proxy tunneling and more!

The Blitzmax libcurl module also includes *c-ares*, a library that performs DNS requests and name resolves asynchronously.

As usual, this module is fully cross-platform with extensive documentation and some basic examples.

This module does not handle SSL encryption (FTPS, HTTPS, etc). For that, you should use the LibCurlSslModule.

You can follow the module progress via the LibCurlModuleChangeLog.
