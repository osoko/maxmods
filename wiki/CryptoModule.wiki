#summary Encryption support with SSL

= Introduction =

Do you need to encrypt data in BlitzMax? Then perhaps this is the module for you.

Utilising OpenSSL's crypto libraries, we gain support for BlowFish, CAST, DES, RC2, RC4 and RC5 encryption/decryption, with a simple API that anyone should be able to master in no time.

===Example===
This short example demonstrates encrypting a set of bytes with the BlowFish algorithm in the Cipher-block chaining mode.
{{{
Local ctx:EVP_CIPHER_CTX = New EVP_CIPHER_CTX.Create()

ctx.EncryptInit(EVP_CIPHER.bf_cbc(), Null, key, iv)

If Not ctx.EncryptUpdate(outbuf, outlen, inbuf, inlen) Then

	Print "Error..."
	End
	
End If

If Not ctx.EncryptFinal(Varptr(outbuf)[outlen], tmplen) Then
	Print "Error..."
	End
End If
outlen :+ tmplen

ctx.Cleanup()
}}}

Check out the examples provided with the module for more detail.
