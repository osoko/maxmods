# About #

BlitzMax is a cross-platform programming language in a style of Object-Oriented BASIC.

Some features include :
  * Function pointers
  * Fully dynamic arrays
  * Inheritance and polymorphism
  * 'By reference' function parameters
  * Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float and Double numeric data types
  * Array and string slicing
  * Flexible 'collection' system for dealing with linked lists etc
  * Low level pointer handling
  * UTF16 strings
  * The ability to 'Incbin' binary data and access it as easily as if it were a regular file
  * External language support for interfacing with C/C++/ObjectiveC or assembly code

And of course, it has **lots** of user-made modules available, which extend its feature-set exponentially... ;-)
