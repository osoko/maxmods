
Using libfmodex.dylib in a Bundle
---------------------------------

libfmodex.dylib needs to be modified to work from inside an application bundle.

When you run "otool -D libfmodex.dylib", it will output the following :

libfmodex.dylib:
./libfmodex.dylib


This won't work with an application bundle. The library name must be prefixed with "@executable_path". We can 
convert it as follows :

install_name_tool -id @executable_path/libfmodex.dylib libfmodex.dylib


When we again run otool, the result will be :

libfmodex.dylib:
@executable_path/libfmodex.dylib


The dylib can now be used inside your application bundle.


The dylib shipped with BaH.FMOD has already been "fixed".
